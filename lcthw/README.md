# Learn C The Hard Way

This is the repo for exercises I will complete while going through the book [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/) by [Zed A. Shaw](https://twitter.com/lzsthw). I began reading this on February 17, 2016 sort of by accident. I wanted to finish LPTHW first, but Zed tweeted a demo video for setting up the dev environment and it had the first exercise done it it, so I couldn't resist! If nothing shows up here for a while, I'm probably still working on LPTHW. Check back here once that is done. ;)
