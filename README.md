# Learning
This is the code from my first dive into programming.

There are three folders in the main directory. 'lpthw' is the directory contating
my exercises from the book
[Learn Python the Hard Way, by Zed A. Shaw](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).
'sicp' is the directory conatining my work from the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).
'lcthw' is the directory containing my exercises from the book [Learn C the Hard Way, by Zed A. Shaw](http://learncthehardway.org/book/).

As of June 26, 2016 I am holding off work on this (again) to focus on school as well as learning Rust.
Thanks for checking this out! :)
