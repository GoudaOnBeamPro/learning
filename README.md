# Learning
This is the code from my first dive into programming.

There are two folders in the main directory. 'lpthw' is the directory contating my exercises from the book
Learn Python the Hard Way, by Zed A. Shaw. 'sicp' is the directory conatining my work from the book Structure
and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

Thanks for checking this out! :)
