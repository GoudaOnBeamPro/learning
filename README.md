This is the code from my first dive into programming.

There are two folders in the main directory. 'lpthw' is the directory contating
my exercises from the book
[Learn Python the Hard Way, by Zed A. Shaw](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).
'sicp' is the directory conatining my work from the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).
