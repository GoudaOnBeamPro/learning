# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
This is the directory for all of my work done thoughout reading Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs. It is an absolutely mind blowing experience
so far, and I'm looking forward to learning more languages like Scheme and Lisp
in the future. I started reading the book on 2/3/2015, and haven't put it down
since. After I finish a bit of this, I'll go back to Learn Python the Hard Way
and maybe have more knowledge help me out there. It's going to be quite the
journey! Thanks for reading this. :)

The full text of the book is availible online for FREE from The MIT Press [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).
