# Learn Python the Hard Way
This is the directory for all of my exercises from the book
Learn Python the Hard Way, by Zed A. Shaw. The book is offered online for free
[here](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).

I started the book sometime in mid-Decemeber of 2015, knowing that I'd have
to teach myself programming before I would be able to get into a computer
science program at a university (although looking back on it now, that isn't
necessarily true). As of 5/27/2016, I have resumed my progress in the book and
I am now over half way throught it! I imagine that the rest of it will be
completed within the next few months now that I have a slightly less hectic
schedule.
