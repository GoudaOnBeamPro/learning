This is the directory for all of my exercises from the book
Learn Python the Hard Way, by Zed A. Shaw. 

I started the book sometime in mid-Decemeber of 2015, knowing that I'd have
to teach myself programming before I would be able to get into a computer
science program at a university. As of 2/8/2015, I'm holding off on completing
this book so that I can go through SICP. I will probably come back and do some more after I complete its first chapter.
