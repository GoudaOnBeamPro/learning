#Exercise 36: Desigining and Debugging

This is the folder that will contain the work for my project from this
exercise. My goal is to go ALL OUT and produce a text adventure game
that will deserve its own repo. I have a lot of ideas brewing in my
head for this game and I'm excited to share them with the rest of the
world.
